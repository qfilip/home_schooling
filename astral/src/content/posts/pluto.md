1. **Dwarf Planet**: Pluto was traditionally considered the ninth planet in our solar system until its reclassification as a dwarf planet by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) in 2006.

2. **Discovered in 1930**: Pluto was discovered on February 18, 1930, by astronomer Clyde Tombaugh at the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona.

3. **Eccentric Orbit**: Pluto has a highly eccentric orbit, which means it is not perfectly circular. Its orbit is also inclined relative to the plane of the solar system.

4. **Charon**: Pluto has five known moons, with the largest being Charon. Charon is so massive compared to Pluto that the two bodies are sometimes referred to as a binary system.

5. **Thin Atmosphere**: Pluto has a thin atmosphere primarily composed of nitrogen, with traces of methane and carbon monoxide.

6. **Orbital Resonance**: Pluto's orbit is in a 3:2 orbital resonance with Neptune, ensuring that the two planets never come into close proximity to each other.

7. **Heart-shaped Feature**: In 2015, NASA's New Horizons spacecraft discovered a large heart-shaped region on Pluto's surface, informally named "Tombaugh Regio" after the planet's discoverer.

8. **Surface Composition**: Pluto's surface is composed of a mixture of ices, including nitrogen, methane, and carbon monoxide, as well as rocky material.

9. **Far from the Sun**: Pluto is the farthest known planet (or dwarf planet) from the Sun in our solar system, with a distance varying between about 30 and 50 astronomical units (AU).

10. **New Horizons Mission**: NASA's New Horizons spacecraft provided unprecedented insights into Pluto during its flyby in 2015, revealing diverse surface features and showcasing the dynamic nature of this distant world.
